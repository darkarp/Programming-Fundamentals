There are plenty of online resources for learning programming languages. However, very few, if any, actually attempt to provide a full-picture view as well as a low-level one, integrating and creating relationships between how / why a computer works and how / why you are able to command it to do your bidding. The purpose of this course/tutorial is also to prepare you for a future guide into reverse engineering, where an understanding of computer architecture and programming is required. What will be covered There will be two main parts of programming fundamentals Introduction to computer architecture Introduction to programming Introduction to computer architecture We will cover the basics of the anatomy of a general digital system and how it works together. We will also cover basic mathematical concepts, such as hexadecimal and binary mathematics and their corresponding notation. Introduction to programming In this section, we will first go over the general concept of a programming language, how they are structured (i.e. grammar and syntax) and we will learn to code in three languages: Python C Assembly There are several benefits of starting the learning process with python: It's easy to learn - it feels like you're typing pseudocode It's extremely useful - you can use it to create virtually anything you want It's a high-level language, allowing you to do many complex tasks in a very short and simple way We will also look into C because it's a very powerful language, in which you can code in a much lower-level, allowing you to fully grasp its connection with assembly . Assembly is chosen at the end for the same purpose C was chosen before. Assembly is the lowest-level language that you are ever likely going to be coding in. Learning it is extremely useful because it provides the necessary context to understand the software-hardware relationship and will be crucial when transitioning into reverse-engineering in the future. Who is this for and what are the requirements? There are no requirements aside from a very small portion of high-school level mathematics. This is intended for anyone who wants to start their learning process about Information Security, programming and/or reverse-engineering. For those who are experienced in the field, this will provide close to no benefit at all, as we will be discussing the most basic of things. It's important for anyone venturing into such a complex field in computer science to have a very solid foundation on these basic aspects. If the foundation isn't strong enough, you will eventually reach a plateau in your studies and you will wonder why you cannot progress. This course/tutorial (This is more of a tutorial than a full course but for the sake of simplicity I will be referring to it as a course) is meant to make sure you progress into your studies with as few knowledge gaps as possible. Asking for help The entire course will try to promote your self-studying ability by introducing many ways in which you can search and find resources. However, everyone will eventually have questions. Besides the usual places ( StackOverflow , Reddit , etc.), there is a discord server designed specifically to help people within the computer security field: WhiteHat Hacking - Join Final remarks This course is not meant to be used by itself, as a lot of the information will be missing. It's meant to be used alongside the video supplements and other resources presented. Each video/livestream will be recorded and uploaded every Saturday, unless something unexpected happens. The corresponding section of this document will be uploaded alongside it.
